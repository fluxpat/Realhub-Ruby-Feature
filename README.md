# Realhub Rails Technical Challenge

This challenge has been designed to test your knowledge of Rails and interfacing with external APIs. Using Ruby on Rails we would like you to create a page where a provider can see a list of their orders, download any artworks and change the status of order items. The source code must be placed on a public repo i.e Github or BitBucket. The application should also be deployed so that we can use it.

## Requirements

* All orders should be displayed that are received from the API.
* The end result should have the same structure as the wireframe provided but please try and make it a bit more visually appealing.
* Orders must be grouped with their order items
* You should be able to download an order items artwork if it exists
* You should be able to toggle the order items status
* Do not use a framework e.g. Bootstrap of Foundation for styles - we want to see how you structure it yourself.

## Bonus Points

* Test code using Rspec
* Use react for the front end

## Resources

* [Realhub API](http://api-docs.realhub.com.au/)
* Mockup (In this repo)

## Closing

We encourage you to use gems and libraries to interact with the API. We are looking for simple, clean and efficient code and a deep understanding of the full stack e.g. Ruby, Rails, CSS (or SASS), HTML and Javascript.
